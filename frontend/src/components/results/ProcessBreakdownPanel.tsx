  "When two chemicals react, their atoms are rearranged: bonds in the reactants break and new bonds form, so entirely new substances appear with different molecular structures, shapes, polarities, oxidation states, and electron distributions (electrons are shared, transferred, or redistributed), and the original substances are consumed while their concentrations fall and the products' concentrations rise until a limiting reactant runs out or an equilibrium is reached. Because the substances themselves change, nearly all their properties change too: color, odor, taste, texture, hardness, density, melting and boiling points, vapor pressure, solubility, viscosity, surface tension, refractive index, light absorption and emission spectra, magnetic behavior, electrical and thermal conductivity, acidity or basicity (pH), reactivity, flammability, stability, toxicity, and the physical state or crystal structure (solid, liquid, gas, dissolved, or precipitated). You may also notice fizzing or bubbles from gas release, a cloudy or solid precipitate forming in a clear liquid, a rise or drop in temperature, glowing, flames, or sparks, hissing or popping sounds, and changes in volume or pressure (especially in closed containers where gases form). Energetically, chemical potential energy is converted into heat, light, electricity, or mechanical work (exothermic) or absorbed from the surroundings (endothermic), so enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy change, and the activation energy barrier, reaction rate, and extent of reaction depend on temperature, concentration, surface area, pressure, and catalysts. Even the number of molecules can change (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O turns three molecules into two). What does not change are the atoms themselves (their types and counts, nuclei, and identities), the total mass, the total electric charge, and the total energy, all of which are conserved and only rearranged, which is why the reaction is a chemical change rather than a nuclear one.";
